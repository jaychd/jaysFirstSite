        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas and graduated from St. Mary's University in 2011 while working as a student for the Department of Defense.  I later took a job with Apple and later moved to Austin, Texas in 2016 in pursuit of better opportunies within the company.  It ended up not working out and a few months later I took a position with a Home Health company as a Help Desk Specialist and later promoted to their IT Manager.</p>
        <p>After working there for 3 years, I took a position with the State of Texas working for the Texas Parks & Wildlife department.  I was thankful for the opportunity but I ultimately chose to leave my position to focus on trying to find my place in the IT world.</p>

        <h3 class="whyHeading">Why I chose to be a Full-Stack Developer</h3>
        <img class="pcIcon"src="images/pc.png" alt="pc">
        <p class="whyParagraph">Im a tech nerd who's worn many hats the past 10 years working in the IT industry.  I've always classified myself as a person whos good in a lot of areas but never an expert in one.  I grew somewhat tired of not having a specialty and earning a mediocre salary.  I knew I was meant for something more.  So after much debate I resigned from my position at Texas Parks & Wildlife and decided to pursue a career in web development.  I hope that this leap of faith leads me to a long and fruitful career as a Full-Stack Developer!</p>

        <h3>Random facts about me</h3>
        <p>If im not working on my Web Dev skills, im usually hanging out with my wife when she's not working.  If not you can usually find me sitting at my computer gaming with friends or watching YouTube videos.</p>
        <p>I also have a small YouTube Channel that I do as a hobby.  I mainly post reviews on tech or whatever hobby I'm into at the moment.  Most of my recent videos are on custom mechanical keyboards but I hope to expand to review other tech and help people make their purchasing decision from the average consumer's point of view.</p>
